# Data Science Projects

Welcome to my Data Science Projects Repository! This repository contains a collection of my data science projects, showcasing my skills and expertise in the field. Each project demonstrates different aspects of data analysis, machine learning, and visualization.

## Projects

### 1. Sleep Disorder Prediction

- **Description:** The project aims to predict sleep disorders and their types by analyzing lifestyle and medical variables, such as age, BMI, sleep duration, blood pressure, and more. Compare the model accuracy between Decision Tree Clasifier vs Random Forest Classifier
- **Technologies Used:** Random Forest Classifier and Decision Tree classifier
- **Results:** The Random Forest Classifier performed well with an accuracy of 89%.

### 2. Titanic Survival Prediction

- **Description:** The project aims to predict survival of titanic passenger based on their Age, Gender and others and compare the various prediction model accuracy.
- **Technologies Used:** Naive Bayes vs Decision Tree classifier vs Random Forest Classifier vs Neural Network
- **Results:** The Random Forest Classifier performed well with an accuracy of 89%.

### 3. House Price Prediction

- **Description:** The project predicts the house price after studying the variables such as location, area, bredroom, bathroom count and many more.
- **Technologies Used:** The notebooks uses Linear Regression, Ridge Regression and Random Forest Regressor
- **Results:** The Random Forest Regressor performed best with accuracy of 87.89%
